## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
MVVM is an architectural pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface (the View) from the business logic (the ViewModel). It allows for the separation of concerns, making the code easier to maintain and test.

## Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the concerns of software into different layers. These layers help in achieving separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. It typically consists of the following layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.

## Retrofit
Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST-based webservice. It simplifies the process of making network requests and processing the JSON responses.
